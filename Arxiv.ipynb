In this survey we discuss the fundamental problem of mapping\\ngraphs to vectors, and its relation with mathematical programming. We discuss\\napplications, solution methods, dimensional reduction techniques and some of\\ntheir limits. We then present an application of some of these ideas to neural\\nnetworks, showing that distance geometry techniques can give competitive\\nperformance with respect to more traditional graph-to-vector mappings.'},\n",

Traditional computing practices, in which\\nresearchers use laptops or shared campus-resident resources, are inadequate for\\nexperiments at the massive scale and varied scope that we now see in data\\nscience. On the other hand, modern cloud computing promises seemingly unlimited\\ncomputational resources that can be custom configured, and seems to offer a\\npowerful new venue for ambitious data-driven science. Exploiting the cloud\\nfully, the amount of work that could be completed in a fixed amount of time can\\nexpand by several orders of magnitude.\\n  As potentially powerful as cloud-based experimentation may be in the\\nabstract, it has not yet become a standard option for researchers in many\\nacademic disciplines. The prospect of actually conducting massive computational\\nexperiments in today's cloud systems confronts the potential user with daunting\\nchallenges. Leading considerations include: (i) the seeming complexity of\\ntoday's cloud computing interface, (ii) the difficulty of executing an\\noverwhelmingly large number of jobs, and (iii) the difficulty of monitoring and\\ncombining a massive collection of separate results. Starting a massive\\nexperiment `bare-handed' seems therefore highly problematic and prone to rapid\\n`researcher burn out'.\\n  New software stacks are emerging that render massive cloud experiments\\nrelatively painless. Such stacks simplify experimentation by systematizing\\nexperiment definition, automating distribution and management of tasks, and\\nallowing easy harvesting of results and documentation. In this article, we\\ndiscuss several painless computing stacks that abstract away the difficulties\\nof massive experimentation, thereby allowing a proliferation of ambitious\\nexperiments for scientific discovery.\",\n",

On the other hand, modern cloud computing promises seemingly unlimited\\ncomputational resources that can be custom configured, and seems to offer a\\npowerful new venue for ambitious data-driven science. Exploiting the cloud\\nfully, the amount of work that could be completed in a fixed amount of time can\\nexpand by several orders of magnitude.\\n  As potentially powerful as cloud-based experimentation may be in the\\nabstract, it has not yet become a standard option for researchers in many\\nacademic disciplines. The prospect of actually conducting massive computational\\nexperiments in today's cloud systems confronts the potential user with daunting\\nchallenges. Leading considerations include: (i) the seeming complexity of\\ntoday's cloud computing interface, (ii) the difficulty of executing an\\noverwhelmingly large number of jobs, and (iii) the difficulty of monitoring and\\ncombining a massive collection of separate results. Starting a massive\\nexperiment `bare-handed' seems therefore highly problematic and prone to rapid\\n`researcher burn out'.\\n  New software stacks are emerging that render massive cloud experiments\\nrelatively painless. Such stacks simplify experimentation by systematizing\\nexperiment definition, automating distribution and management of tasks, and\\nallowing easy harvesting of results and documentation. In this article, we\\ndiscuss several painless computing stacks that abstract away the difficulties\\nof massive experimentation, thereby allowing a proliferation of ambitious\\nexperiments for scientific discovery.\"},\n",

       "  'summary': 'Data science is a discipline that provides principles, methodology and\\nguidelines for the analysis of data for tools, values, or insights. Driven by a\\nhuge workforce demand, many academic institutions have started to offer degrees\\nin data science, with many at the graduate, and a few at the undergraduate\\nlevel. Curricula may differ at different institutions, because of varying\\nlevels of faculty expertise, and different disciplines (such as Math, computer\\nscience, and business etc) in developing the curriculum. The University of\\nMassachusetts Dartmouth started offering degree programs in data science from\\nFall 2015, at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Quite a few\\narticles have been published that deal with graduate data science courses, much\\nless so dealing with undergraduate ones. Our discussion will focus on\\nundergraduate course structure and function, and specifically, a first course\\nin data science.

Driven by a\\nhuge workforce demand, many academic institutions have started to offer degrees\\nin data science, with many at the graduate, and a few at the undergraduate\\nlevel. Curricula may differ at different institutions, because of varying\\nlevels of faculty expertise, and different disciplines (such as Math, computer\\nscience, and business etc) in developing the curriculum. The University of\\nMassachusetts Dartmouth started offering degree programs in data science from\\nFall 2015, at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Quite a few\\narticles have been published that deal with graduate data science courses, much\\nless so dealing with undergraduate ones.

COVID-19 has largely impacted on our\\nsocieties through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy\\nmeasures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the\\nmultifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including\\npeople's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has\\nchanged significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and\\nquarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at\\ninternational (cross-border), national and regional level. At international\\nlevel, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has\\nplunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of\\nflights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United\\nStates announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating\\ncountries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March\\n10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major\\ncity: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain).\\nWithin all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We\\nalso identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of\\nposts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in\\nthe beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram\\ndoubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among\\nInstagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's\\nsocial behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram\\ndata and primary survey data.\",\n",

The method is applicable for\\nlarge sets of non-Gaussian or strange data obtained in information technology.\\nIn confirming the hypothesis of Koshland, the application of the method to the\\nintensity data of digital X-ray diffraction spectra with the calculation of the\\ncollective effect makes it possible to identify a conformer exhibiting\\nbiological activity.',\n",

The algorithm is\\ninvariant for linear transformations of the initial data set, has\\nrenormalization-group invariance, and determines the intensity of\\ncross-correlation (collective effect) of the data.

In this work,\\nwe introduce the ML provenance tracking problem: the fundamental idea is to\\nautomatically track which columns in a dataset have been used to derive the\\nfeatures/labels of an ML model. We discuss the challenges in capturing such\\ninformation in the context of Python, the most common language used by data\\nscientists. We then present Vamsa, a modular system that extracts provenance\\nfrom Python scripts without requiring any changes to the users' code. Using 26K\\nreal data science scripts, we verify the effectiveness of Vamsa in terms of\\ncoverage, and performance. We also evaluate Vamsa's accuracy on a smaller\\nsubset of manually labeled data. Our analysis shows that Vamsa's precision and\\nrecall range from 90.4% to 99.1% and its latency is in the order of\\nmilliseconds for average size scripts.

In general, with\\nnon-adaptive data analyses (where queries to the data are generated without\\nbeing influenced by answers to previous queries) a data set containing $n$\\nsamples may support exponentially many queries in $n$. This number reduces to\\nlinearly many under naive adaptive data analysis, and even sophisticated\\nremedies such as the Reusable Holdout (Dwork et. al 2015) only allow\\nquadratically many queries in $n$.\\n  In this work, we propose a new framework for adaptive science which\\nexponentially improves on this number of queries under a restricted yet\\nscientifically relevant setting, where the goal of the scientist is to find a\\nsingle (or a few) true hypotheses about the universe based on the samples. Such\\na setting may describe the search for predictive factors of some disease based\\non medical data, where the analyst may wish to try a number of predictive\\nmodels until a satisfactory one is found.\\n  Our solution, the Generic Holdout, involves two simple ingredients: (1) a\\npartitioning of the data into a exploration set and a holdout set and (2) a\\nlimited exposure strategy for the holdout set. An analyst is free to use the\\nexploration set arbitrarily, but when testing hypotheses against the holdout\\nset, the analyst only learns the answer to the question: \"Is the given\\nhypothesis true (empirically) on the holdout set?\" -- and no more information,\\nsuch as \"how well\" the hypothesis fits the holdout set. The resulting scheme is\\nimmediate to analyze, but despite its simplicity we do not believe our method\\nis obvious, as evidenced by the many violations in practice.\\n  Our proposal can be seen as an alternative to pre-registration, and allows\\nresearchers to get the benefits of adaptive data analysis without the problems\\nof adaptivity.',\n",
